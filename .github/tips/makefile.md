## My notes

GNU Makefile is used for an shortcut to
long annoying command which we need to repeat it a lot.

Recently, it's now been famously used in mac and linux users.

Also, [gRPC Golang](https://www.udemy.com/course/grpc-golang) projects use it as an README guide to compile, test or\
some customized command in cases to compile .proto and .protoc file
