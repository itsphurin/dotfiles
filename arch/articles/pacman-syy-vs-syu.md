## The commands `pacman -Syy` vs `pacman -Syu`

```sh
$ pacman -Syy

# This command refreshes the package databases from the servers
# defined in your Pacman configuration (/etc/pacman.conf),
# but it does not upgrade any packages.

# Specifically, -Sy tells Pacman to refresh
# the package database(s) (sync), and the second y (-Syy)
# forces a refresh even if the local database is considered
# up to date according to the last synchronization time.

# Usage: Typically used when you suspect the package databases
# might be out of sync or corrupted, and you want to force a full refresh.

# Conclusion: It's like `brew update`
```

```sh
$ pacman -Syu

# This command not only refreshes the package databases (-Sy)
# but also performs a full system upgrade (-u).

# It installs the latest versions of all packages that are
# currently installed on your system.

# Usage: This is the standard command used to update all packages
# on your Arch Linux system to their latest versions.

# Conclusion: It's like `brew update && brew upgrade`
```


#### Key Differences:

- Purpose: `pacman -Syy` is used to refresh package databases only,
  : without upgrading any packages, whereas `pacman -Syu`
  : upgrades all packages after refreshing the databases.

- Safety Note: It's generally safe to use `pacman -Syy`,
  : but `pacman -Syu` should be used with caution as it updates
  : all packages and can potentially introduce compatibility issues
  : if not managed carefully.

#### When to Use Which:

- Use `pacman -Syy` when you only want to refresh the package databases,
  : especially if you suspect they are out of date or corrupted.

- Use `pacman -Syu` when you want to update all packages on your system
  : to their latest versions after ensuring the package databases are up to date.

#### Example Scenarios:

After adding or removing custom repositories\
(pacman -Syy may be needed to refresh after adding new repos).\
Before performing a system upgrade (pacman -Syu ensures the system is fully updated).

In summary, the main difference lies in whether you want to refresh\
package databases only (pacman -Syy) or perform a full system upgrade (pacman -Syu)\
which includes refreshing the databases as a preliminary step.
